To get started, you'll need Erlang 18 and Elixir 1.3.0 installed.

You can _probably_ get by with just using homebrew for these.
  * `brew install erlang`
  * `brew install elixir`

To start the Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
